## What Is Astroturfing?

**Astroturfing** is when corporations, political operatives, or special interest groups create fake grassroots campaigns to manufacture the appearance of organic public support. The name comes from AstroTurf — fake grass.

### Real Examples

- **Crowds on Demand** pays people $60 to attend rallies, $200 for speaking roles
- **Entergy New Orleans** hired ~50 paid actors to support a $210M power plant at city council meetings (resulted in $5 million fine)
- **Dallas Justice Now** was a fake BLM organization created by a billionaire hotelier to push his agenda

- Organizations with generic names like "Citizens For [X]" or "Americans For [Y]"
- Three-word patriotic names (common in astroturf operations)
- Recently formed nonprofits with vague purposes
- Geographic clustering in politically strategic states
- Connections to known paid protest services

## Case Studies

### Entergy New Orleans (2017-2018)
Around 50 people in matching orange shirts appeared at city council meetings to support a controversial $210M power plant. Investigation revealed many were paid actors hired through Crowds on Demand. The utility's CEO texted executives: *"This is war and we need all the foot soldiers we can muster."*

**Outcome:** $5 million fine — the largest ever imposed by the New Orleans City Council

### Dallas Astroturf Network (2020-2024)
Billionaire hotel owner Monty Bennett funded a network of fake advocacy groups through Crowds on Demand:
- Keep Dallas Safe
- Dallas Justice Now (posed as a BLM chapter)
- Save Texas Kids
- Protect Texas Kids
- Mission DFW

The Dallas Express, a "pink slime" news site, ran 112+ articles amplifying these fake groups.

**Outcome:** Journalist Steven Monacelli won a defamation lawsuit after exposing the network
