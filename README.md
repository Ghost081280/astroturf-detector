## What Is Astroturfing?

**Astroturfing** is when corporations, political operatives, or special interest groups create fake grassroots campaigns to manufacture the appearance of organic public support. The name comes from AstroTurf — fake grass.

> *"A fellow from Texas can tell the difference between grass roots and AstroTurf."*  
> — Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who coined the term in 1985

### Why It Matters

- **Undermines democracy** by creating illusions of public consensus
- **Drowns out authentic voices** with manufactured support
- **Deceives policymakers and journalists** who rely on public input
- **Hides corporate interests** behind patriotic-sounding names
- **Costs millions** — the Entergy scandal alone resulted in a $5 million fine

## Exposed: Real Astroturf Scandals

### Entergy New Orleans ($5 Million Fine)
Around 50 people in matching orange shirts appeared at city council meetings to support a controversial $210M power plant. Investigation revealed they were **paid actors hired through Crowds on Demand** at $60 each. The utility's CEO texted executives:

> *"This is war and we need all the foot soldiers we can muster."*

**Result:** Largest fine ever imposed by New Orleans City Council

### Dallas Fake Advocacy Network
Billionaire hotel owner Monty Bennett funded a network of fake groups through Crowds on Demand:
- **Dallas Justice Now** — posed as a BLM chapter
- **Keep Dallas Safe** — fake pro-police group  
- **Save Texas Kids** / **Protect Texas Kids** / **Mission DFW**

The Dallas Express, a "pink slime" news site, ran **112+ articles** amplifying these fake groups.

**Result:** Journalist Steven Monacelli won defamation lawsuit after exposing the network

### Forged Letters to Congress (2009)
**Bonner & Associates** sent forged letters to Congress opposing climate legislation, supposedly from groups like the NAACP and American Legion. The letters were completely fabricated.

**Result:** Congressional investigation, exposed as industry-funded astroturf

### Facebook's Anti-Google Campaign (2011)
**Burson-Marsteller**, one of the world's largest PR firms, was caught running a covert campaign to plant negative stories about Google in major newspapers — secretly funded by Facebook.

**Result:** USA Today exposé, PR industry embarrassment

## Connect the Dots

Our AI analyzes correlations between data sources to identify coordinated activity:

- **Geographic Matches** — Job postings appearing in cities with protest news
- **Naming Patterns** — "Citizens For X" / "Americans For Y" naming conventions
- **Timing Clusters** — Multiple suspicious orgs forming before major events
- **News Clustering** — Multiple articles about paid protesters in same region
- **High-Risk New Orgs** — Recently filed committees with red flag characteristics

Each connection shows a **probability score** based on evidence strength.

## What Gets Flagged

The system looks for these warning signs:

### Job Postings
- "Paid protest," "hold signs," "same day cash"  
- "Rally attendees needed," "event staff" with political context  
- Vague descriptions with unusually high pay  
- NDA requirements for advocacy work

### Organizations  
- Generic names like "Citizens For [X]" or "Americans For [Y]"  
- Three-word patriotic names (common astroturf pattern)  
- Recently formed with immediate high spending  
- Delaware incorporation (minimal disclosure)  
- Boards with fewer than 3 people  
- No website or vague mission statement

### Behavioral Patterns
- Business hours only activity (paid workers vs. volunteers)  
- Identical messaging across platforms  
- Sudden activity spikes before political events  
- Geographic clustering in swing states

## How We Detect Astroturf

Our methodology is informed by academic research on manufactured grassroots:

### Coordination Detection
Research shows **74% of astroturf accounts** exhibit co-tweeting and co-retweeting patterns — synchronized messaging that real grassroots movements don't display.

### Timing Analysis  
Genuine grassroots activity happens 24/7. Astroturf campaigns often show **business hours patterns** (9-5) because participants are paid workers, not passionate volunteers.

### "Cash-Rich, People-Poor"
Real grassroots movements are people-rich but cash-poor. Astroturf is the opposite — lots of money, few actual supporters. We flag organizations with high spending but minimal visible membership.

### Name Pattern Analysis
Academic research confirms astroturf groups commonly use:
- Generic patriotic terms (freedom, liberty, American)
- "Citizens for" / "Americans for" / "Families for" constructions
- Vague positive words (progress, prosperity, future)
- Three-word names that sound grassroots but lack specificity

## The Dark Money Pipeline

How corporate money becomes "grassroots":

```
Corporation
    ↓
Trade Association (lobbying group)
    ↓
501(c)(4) "Social Welfare" Org (no donor disclosure)
    ↓
Astroturf Group with patriotic name
    ↓
"Concerned citizens" at your city council
```

Example: Telecom companies funneled **$4.2 million** through Broadband for America, which generated **8.5 million fake FCC comments** opposing net neutrality.
